I'm a passionate technologist. I've been breaking and tweaking things since my adolescence, when I unassembled the modified PS2 (containing
an IDE HDD with some games) my father gave me and wrote my first lines of Windows batch script to send to a few friends as an exe in order
to see their computers shutdown. The skills I used as the skiddie among my friends quickly and extensively evolved into what makes me the
versatile software developer I am today.

I'm constantly curious about how technologies work. As a hobby and a career, I love to create solutions using tools that I want to learn
about. I'm often mentioned by my coworkers as someone who brings the will to experiment and improve to the teams I work in. I consider this
as being one of my greatest strengths: the speed in which I start using things I did not previously know how to use. I'm always thinking
about what are the things that could be created, tested or learned. How could I improve my own life using the skills I apply in my
professional life everyday?

I'm very interested in the JavaScript language and its ecosystem lately, since it's possible to create all the different kinds of
applications using it, from mobile to desktop or a full stack web application, exclusively with JS-based stacks. Most recently, I've created
a very simple project (among others) using Electron to help my team manage our build monitor. Besides JS, I'm full of other interests
regarding other things I want to learn and use, like IoT with Raspberry Pi, Linux and AWS.

What my experience has shown me so far is that I might not always be the most experienced person in a team, or I might not always know all
that seems to be needed in order to accomplish something, but the passion and the will I bring with me can highly compensate a possible lack
of experience or knowledge, because I will always carry a desire to go further in the way I need in order for me or the teams I work in to
succeed.
