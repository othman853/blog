Intial productive boost
  - great for prototyping
  - great for quick solutions and scripting

Versatility There's a strong reason why Python became so popular. It's extremely versatile. You can solve a huge amount of different
problems: from a simple scripting to data science and machine learning.

Build Tooling When working with complex projects, it's always nice to automate things and create toolings to make our miserable lives
slightly more bearable. Dynamic languages are an extremely comfortable choice for building such tools, since they're very productive for
smaller projects and are easy to learn when you're team has some experience with programming, so the whole can get involved if they want to.

Build relatively small projects We're now constantly talking about things like microservices. There's an importante place for dynamic
languages in that landscape. I can definitely see myself writing, say, a small restful service in Python on a microservices environment.

It's much faster to do my job Since I don't need to compile things, it's generally much faster to do what I'm supposed to while developing
something on my machine (starting up a server, running tests and linters, etc). In most cases, I even get the privilege to use hot reloading
that works (most of the time). 

It's very fun to use a dynamic language When conciseness is not a big constraint (like in a pet project), dynamic languages become
particularly fun.

They enable us to solve certain problems much faster

There are way too many people in this world, which means the there are way too many problems to be solved. Some people have really big
problems that can be solved with not a lot of technology. That's when dynamic languages really shine. It's amazing to use rails, django
admin or flask admin to build a system for an NGO, for instance. 

I have big trust issues with dynamic and would personally avoid using them on big/complex projects. 

Fortunately, I will probably never work alone and there will always be plenty o people to disagree with me and show why I should trust
dynamic languages a little more. 

It's impressive to see cases like GitHub. Should I be so surprised? Or should I trusted dynamic languages more?
