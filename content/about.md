I am a passionate technologist that enjoys solving problems and, sometimes, creating them as well. I love to create, teach, share and
explore software.

The moment I realized I wanted to do computer related stuff for a living was during my early teenage days, when I felt the need to get more
games for my PlayStation 2. I had to disassemble it (since it used HDD instead of DVD to run the games), search obscure Internet forums for
pirate games and learn how to do the wiring of an HDD into a computer. I learned a lot from that experience and fell in love with the whole
Hardware_Software_Hacking universe right away.

Not a lot has changed since then. I am still the very same passionate individual. The difference lies mainly upon the experience I’ve
gathered along my journey and how it shaped my passion for technology.

Today I see myself (based mostly on the feedbacks I receive from the people that work with me on a daily basis) as a mature and very
flexible software developer that can work in a variety of projects and tech stacks, learning fast and teaching other people as well.

I’m currently focusing on three things:
- Establishing a stronger theoretical software background (so I’m back into college)
- Teaching people whatever I can (through the [Aceleradora](https://info.thoughtworks.com/aceleradora) initiative and internally, sharing
  with my team mates)
- Learning what my client needs me to know (focusing on their business, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform and the Kotlin language)
