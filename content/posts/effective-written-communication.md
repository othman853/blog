Real lifeish examples of simple principles and practices that help keep written communication nice and effective.

I've been receiving some very good feedbacks regarding my written communication so I thought it would make sense to share some of the things
I consider when writting something to someone.

The context
  Does the person you're talking to actually knows what you're talking about?
  Are there any words that may cause them to not read the rest of the message due to automatic rejection?

The structure
  Make sure the things you're writing are straightforward and well structured (both syntatically and semantically).

The hierarchy
  Find a way to highlight what's really important. That's why people invented bold weight and title hierarchies.

The right details in the right level
  What questions can you antecipate with the content you're about to send?

The echo
  When responding someone, write what you understood from their message, so that they can double check that you've got the right
message.

The links
  Just send the links when you have them.

The feedback
  Before hitting send, ask for a colleague of yours to review what you just wrote. It's often interesting to give them no hints about what
you're writting about, like testing your UI with real users. Remember.

It should (or shouldn't) be an email
  Maybe that meeting could have been an email, saving everyone's times.

Be polite
 It never hurts to say things like hello or thanks. That's just human protocol, follow it.
